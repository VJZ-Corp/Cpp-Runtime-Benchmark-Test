# C++-Runtime-Benchmark-Test
A command line utility tool by Vincent Zhang that test's your C++ runtime environment. The program will make your computer undergo a series of 5 different benchmark diagnostics.

<h1>How to use?</h1>
This program is designed to be used as a CLI utility tool. That means you cannot run the .exe file without using command prompt. The basic startup command for this program is

> **benchmark --start**

From there, you can follow the instructions within the program. Use **benchmark /help** for more information. We recommend you to put benchmark.exe in your C:/Users/_YOURNAME_ folder. Because command prompt's default directory is your user directory, accessing this .exe file will be easy and will require no directory changing.

<h1>Download</h1>
The source code of this program is proprietary, so only release binaries are posted here. Do not clone the repository; instead, click on benchmark.exe and click "View Raw", your file should automatically begin downloading.
